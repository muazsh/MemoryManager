# Memory Leak Manager

This is a simple tool that enables detecting and cleaning memory leaks, the idea is that memory leaks take place when there are some allocations in the heap and there are no references in the stack directly or indirectly point to those allocatations.

This tool overloads `new` and `delete` operators to keep track of what is allocated and what is freed.

Due to differences in stack memory management between compilers, this tool detects and collects all memory leaks for GCC, Clang and MSVC x64 compilers, but for MSVC x86 it can detect and collect all leaks in a function call where `CollectGarbage` function is called after the leaker function context is finished, and if the call of ` CollectGarbage` is in a function where leak took place I distinguish between 2 cases of memory leak, see the testing examples in the MemeoryLeakManager.cpp file. 

The tool can distinguish between leaks and indirect pointers (those pointers which have no references in the stack because they are pointers inside some other pointers), so such case is tested on compiler MSVC x86 with no problems.

# Usage:
- First of all when the program begins or when you still think no leak has been occured the stack top address should be obtained like:
```c++
int dummy = 0;
g_stackTop = &dummy; // g_stackTop is a global variable declared in MemeoryLeakManager.hpp
```
- Somewhere in the program where you think memory leak took place call:
```c++
CollectGarbage();
```
- `DetectMemoryLeak` function detects and prints out memory leak places in the code without calling `delete` on those leaks, so it can be used for profiling for example.

# Limitations:
- Since threads have their own stacks, this tool should be used carefully in case of multi-threaded applications, otherwise it would not be accurate.
- The tool assumes a continuous stack memory space, which is not of C++ standard, but for most if not all compilers the stack is a whole and not fragmented.
